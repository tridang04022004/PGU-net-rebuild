# Progressive Growing U-Net (PGU-Net) Architecture

## Overview

PGU-Net implements progressive training strategy where network complexity and input resolution increase gradually across 4 stages: 32×32 → 64×64 → 128×128 → 256×256.

## Key Features

- **Progressive Training**: Start simple, gradually increase complexity
- **Multi-scale Fusion**: Combine predictions from multiple decoder levels
- **Stage-wise Architecture**: 4 different network configurations
- **Stable Training**: Better convergence than training large networks from scratch

## Architecture Stages

| Stage | Resolution | Depth    | Channels | Multi-scale Outputs |
| ----- | ---------- | -------- | -------- | ------------------- |
| 1     | 32×32      | 2 levels | 512      | 1                   |
| 2     | 64×64      | 3 levels | 256      | 2                   |
| 3     | 128×128    | 4 levels | 128      | 3                   |
| 4     | 256×256    | 5 levels | 64       | 4                   |

## Core Components

- **DoubleConv**: 3×3 Conv + BatchNorm + ReLU (×2)
- **Down**: MaxPool2d + DoubleConv (encoder)
- **Up**: Bilinear upsample + skip connection + DoubleConv (decoder)
- **OutConv**: 1×1 Conv for final predictions

## Stage Architectures

### Stage 1 (32×32)

```
Input → InConv(512) → Down → Up → OutConv → Output
```

- Simple 2-level network
- Single output scale

### Stage 2 (64×64)

```
Input → InConv(256) → Down×2 → Up×2 → Multi-scale Fusion
```

- 3-level network
- Combines 2 output scales

### Stage 3 (128×128)

```
Input → InConv(128) → Down×3 → Up×3 → Multi-scale Fusion
```

- 4-level network
- Combines 3 output scales

### Stage 4 (256×256)

```
Input → InConv(64) → Down×4 → Up×4 → Multi-scale Fusion
```

- Full 5-level network
- Combines 4 output scales
  Up(1024→256) → x5 (256×32×32) [skip: x3]

## Key Design Features

- **Multi-scale Fusion**: Each stage combines predictions from multiple decoder levels
- **Inverted Channel Strategy**: Fewer initial channels in later stages (512→256→128→64)
- **Progressive Complexity**: Network depth increases with resolution
- **Skip Connections**: U-Net style encoder-decoder connections

## Training Strategy

Each stage is trained independently with weight transfer between stages:

1. **Stage 1**: Learn basic shapes at 32×32
2. **Stage 2**: Add multi-scale features at 64×64
3. **Stage 3**: Refine details at 128×128
4. **Stage 4**: High-resolution processing at 256×256

## Advantages

- **Stable Training**: Progressive approach reduces optimization difficulty
- **Better Performance**: Multi-scale fusion improves segmentation accuracy
- **Efficient**: Earlier stages train faster with smaller networks
- **Flexible**: Can deploy different stages based on computational constraints

## Implementation

```python
# Create progressive trainer
trainer = ProgressiveTrainer(in_channels=1, num_classes=1)

# Train each stage
for stage in [1, 2, 3, 4]:
    trainer.current_stage = stage
    trainer.current_model = trainer.models[stage]
    # Train with appropriate resolution data
```

PGU-Net is particularly effective for medical image segmentation where both global context and fine details are crucial for accurate results.

#### 1. **Inverted Channel Strategy**

- Later stages start with fewer channels but deeper networks
- Balances computational efficiency with representation power
- Stage 1: 512 channels, 2 levels
- Stage 4: 64 channels, 5 levels

#### 2. **Multi-scale Output Fusion**

- Each decoder level produces predictions
- Outputs are upsampled and summed
- Enables learning at multiple scales simultaneously
- Improves gradient flow during training

#### 3. **Skip Connections**

- U-Net style skip connections preserve spatial information
- Concatenation in channel dimension
- Critical for fine-grained segmentation details

#### 4. **Progressive Complexity**

- Network complexity increases with resolution
- Allows model to learn coarse-to-fine representations
- Stable training progression
